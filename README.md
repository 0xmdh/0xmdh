# Hey, I'm Max 
I'm the co-founder of [WakeUp Labs](https://www.wakeuplabs.io), an engineering company building applications, infrastructure, and protocols. I work at the intersection of company strategy, product execution, and business development, taking ideas from concept to implementation with a focus on long-term impact.

My background is in strategy, partnerships, business development, software and finance. I’ve helped scale teams, launch products, and support ecosystem growth. I'm naturally curious and often drawn to connecting ideas from very different areas. That’s usually where I find the most interesting things to build.
