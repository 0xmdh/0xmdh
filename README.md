# Hey, I'm Max 
I'm the co-founder of [WakeUp Labs](https://www.wakeuplabs.io), an engineering company building applications, infrastructure, and protocols. I work at the intersection of company strategy, product execution, and business development, taking ideas from concept to implementation with a focus on long-term impact.

My background is in software engineering, business development, finance, and product strategy. I‚Äôve helped scale teams, launch products, and support ecosystem growth. I'm naturally curious and often drawn to connecting ideas from very different areas. That‚Äôs usually where I find the most interesting things to build.

## About WakeUp Labs

WakeUp Labs is a software engineering company focused on:

- **Core infrastructure** for fintech, web3, and decentralized systems  
- **End-to-end product development**: from strategy and prototyping to deployment  
- **Tooling and protocols** that support scalable ecosystems  
- **Co-created products** with startups, DAOs, and corporations  
- **Hands-on experiments** that turn ideas into working code

We also contribute to governance, research, and collaborate with DAOs, L2s, and protocol foundations to shape long-term ecosystem strategy.
